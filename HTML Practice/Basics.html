        she couldn’t feel her feet touching the floor. <h4>line break</h4><br>She couldn’t feel anything
        except a slight sickness. She did everything without thinking. <h4>Horizontal Break.</h4> <hr> She went
        downstairs to the freezer and took hold of the first object she found. She

            I live inside my own world of make-believe
            Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
            I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
            Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep
            I love everything
            Fire's spreading all around my room
            My world's so bright
            It's hard to breathe but that's alright
            Hush</pre>
